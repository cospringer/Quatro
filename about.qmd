Hello!

I am currently a senior biology major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I have a strong academic background in molecular biology, biochemistry, and cancer genetics. My hands-on experience extends to both academia and pharmaceutical environments, providing me with knowledge about automated western blotting, PCR techniques, cell culture, and more.\
My passion lies in cancer research and I am actively seeking a position in cancer biology, specifically involving mutations in the signaling cascade pathways such as MAPK or PI3K. However, I am very open minded and am ready to learn in any focus or techniques pertaining to the ever evolving realm of cancer research.\
I invite you to connect with me and feel free to message if you have any questions or if there are available positions that align with my skills and aspirations!
